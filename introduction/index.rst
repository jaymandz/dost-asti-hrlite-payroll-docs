How to use this documentation
-----------------------------

This documentation is meant to serve both as an encyclopedia and as a user
manual. You do not need to read through its entirety before using HR Lite and
the Payroll Module, although you may if you want to. You can study all of it,
or any part of it, anytime you want.

This documentation might best serve as a companion while using HR Lite and the
Payroll Module. The only way to master something is through practice, and this
documentation was never meant to be a substitute for practice.
