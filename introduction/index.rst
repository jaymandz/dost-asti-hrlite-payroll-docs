How to use this documentation
-----------------------------

This documentation is meant to serve both as an encyclopedia and as a user

the Payroll Module, although you may if you want to. You can study all of it,
or any part of it, anytime you want.

Libraries
---------

Libraries under the Payroll Module can be found in the *System Setup* page,
which can be accessed anytime by clicking on the *System Setup* menu item
in the sidebar to the left.
