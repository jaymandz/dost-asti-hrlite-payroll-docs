The *Additional/Adjustments* library
====================================

Introduction

The *Additional/Adjustments* library is used to attach arbitrary amounts of
money coming from grants that are otherwise not handled by any other library
in the Payroll Module to the salaries of employees.

The *salary adjustments table* is where all the salary adjustments that have
ever been added are listed. Its rows are sorted by period descending (i.e., the
rows for the latest period are listed first).
