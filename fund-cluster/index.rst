The index page is where you will find a list of all the fund clusters saved in
the database, as well as a few buttons that are described below.

* The *Activate* button (TBA)
* The *Deactivate* button (TBA)
* The *Download as PDF* button (TBA)
* The *New* button brings you to an empty form page, where you will be able to
  add a new fund cluster. The form page is described in the next section.

The form page
-------------

   The *Fund Cluster* form page.

The form page is where you will be able to enter or change information about
any fund clusters you wish to add or edit. It has only one field, labeled
*Description*, which will contain the fund cluster’s description.

How to add a fund cluster
-------------------------

.. Note:: Make sure your account has been granted the necessary action for
   this first.

1. In the index page, click on the *New* button near the top right corner.
2. You will be brought to the form page. Enter a description for the new fund
   cluster in the *Description* field.
3. If you want to clear the form and start over, click on the *Cancel* button.
4. Click on the *Submit* button when you’re done.

The new fund cluster should appear in the fund cluster table.

How to edit a fund cluster
--------------------------

.. Note:: Make sure your account has been granted the necessary action for
   this first.

1. In the fund cluster table, click the update button (the one with a pencil
   icon) for the fund cluster that you wish to edit. You will be brought to the
   form page.
2. The *Description* field will contain the current description for the fund
   cluster. You can change it into anything you wish.

The fund cluster will have a new description in the table. Its last updated
date (shown under the *As of* column) will also have changed.
